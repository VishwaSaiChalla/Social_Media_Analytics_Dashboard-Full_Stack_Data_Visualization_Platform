# Visualization Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to view the visualization generated by the `visualization.py` script in the data visualization project.

## Accessing the Visualization

1. **Run the Visualization Script**:
   - Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   - Execute the `visualization.py` script from the command line:
     ```
     python src/visualization.py
     ```

2. **View the Dashboard**:
   - After running the script, a dashboard will be generated. If the script is set up to run a local server, you can access the dashboard by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000
     ```
   - If the dashboard is generated as a static file, open the `dashboard.png` file to view the output.

## Screenshot

A screenshot of the generated visualization can be found in the project directory as `dashboard.png`. This image provides a visual representation of the trends and insights derived from the data stored in the datastore.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the datastore is running and populated with data before executing the visualization script.
- If you encounter any issues, please refer to the `README.md` for troubleshooting steps and additional information about the project structure.
