# Data Visualization Project

This project aims to demonstrate the process of data ingestion, storage, and visualization using a chosen datastore. It involves generating mock data, storing it in a database, and creating visual representations to analyze trends and insights.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main scripts for data ingestion, visualization, and transformations.
  - **data_ingest.py**: Generates and inserts mock data into the datastore with fields such as category, value, and timestamp.
  - **visualization.py**: Creates visualizations of the stored data, displaying trends and insights through a dashboard.
  - **transformations.py**: Implements data transformations to ensure the data is in the correct format before ingestion.

- **dashboard.png**: A screenshot of the generated visualization, showcasing the output of the dashboard.

- **datastore-setup.md**: Explains the choice of datastore, including the rationale behind selecting the specific database solution and the setup process.

- **data-ingestion.md**: Provides an explanation of how the data ingestion script works, detailing the process of generating and inserting mock data.

- **visualization.md**: Explains how to view the visualization, including instructions for accessing the dashboard and any relevant links.

- **README.md**: This file, providing a high-level overview of the project.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications, specifying the services, networks, and volumes needed for the project.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project, ensuring that the necessary libraries are installed for the scripts to run successfully.
